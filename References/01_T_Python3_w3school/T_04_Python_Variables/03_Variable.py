Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
Remember that variables are case-sensitive """


"""Output Variables
The Python print statement is often used to output variables.

To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the + character:"""



x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x)
