 gzip --- Read and Write GNU zip Files
=======================================

.. module:: gzip
    :synopsis: Read and write gzip files

:Purpose: Read and write gzip files.

The ``gzip`` module provides a file-like interface to GNU zip
files, using :mod:`zlib` to compress and uncompress the data.

Writing Compressed Files
========================

The module-level function ``open()`` creates an instance of the
file-like class ``GzipFile``.  The usual methods for writing and
reading bytes are provided.

.. literalinclude:: gzip_write.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

To write data into a compressed file, open the file with mode
``'wb'``. This example wraps the ``GzipFile`` with a ``TextIOWrapper``
from the :mod:`io` module to encode Unicode text to bytes suitable for
compression.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'gzip_write.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 gzip_write.py
	
	application/x-gzip; charset=binary
	example.txt.gz contains 75 bytes

.. {{{end}}}

Different amounts of compression can be used by passing a
``compresslevel`` argument.  Valid values range from 0 to 9, inclusive.
Lower values are faster and result in less compression.  Higher values
are slower and compress more, up to a point.

.. literalinclude:: gzip_compresslevel.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The center column of numbers in the output shows the size in bytes of
the files produced by compressing the input.  For this input data, the
higher compression values do not necessarily pay off in decreased
storage space.  Results will vary, depending on the input data.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'gzip_compresslevel.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 gzip_compresslevel.py

A ``GzipFile`` instance also includes a ``writelines()`` method
that can be used to write a sequence of strings.

.. literalinclude:: gzip_writelines.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

As with a regular file, the input lines need to include a newline
character.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'gzip_writelines.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 gzip_writelines.py
	
	The same line, over and over.
	The same line, over and over.

Reading Compressed Data
=======================

To read data back from previously compressed files, open the file with
binary read mode (``'rb'``) so no text-based translation of line
endings or Unicode decoding is performed.

.. literalinclude:: gzip_read.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

This example reads the file written by ``gzip_write.py`` from the
previous section, using a ``TextIOWrapper`` to decode the text after
it is decompressed.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'gzip_read.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 gzip_read.py
	
	Contents of the example file go here.
	

.. {{{end}}}

While reading a file, it is also possible to seek and read only part
of the data.

.. literalinclude:: gzip_seek.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The ``seek()`` position is relative to the *uncompressed* data, so
the caller does not need to know that the data file is compressed.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'gzip_seek.py'))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 gzip_seek.py
	
	Entire file:
	b'Contents of the example file go here.\n'
	Starting at position 5 for 10 bytes:
	b'nts of the'
	
	True

.. {{{end}}}


Working with Streams
====================

The ``GzipFile`` class can be used to wrap other types of data
streams so they can use compression as well.  This is useful when the
data is being transmitted over a socket or an existing
(already open) file handle.  A :mod:`BytesIO` buffer can also be
used.

.. literalinclude:: gzip_BytesIO.py
    :caption:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

One benefit of using ``GzipFile`` over :mod:`zlib` is that it
supports the file API.  However, when re-reading the previously
compressed data, an explicit length is passed to ``read()``.
Leaving the length off resulted in a CRC error, possibly because
``BytesIO`` returned an empty string before reporting EOF.  When
working with streams of compressed data, either prefix the data with
an integer representing the actual amount of data to be read or use
the incremental decompression API in :mod:`zlib`.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'gzip_BytesIO.py', break_lines_at=65))
.. }}}

.. code-block:: none

	$ python3 gzip_BytesIO.py
