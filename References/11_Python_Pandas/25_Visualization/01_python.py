Python Pandas - Visualization


Basic Plotting: plot
This functionality on Series and DataFrame is just a simple wrapper around the matplotlib libraries plot() method.

"""

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10,4),index=pd.date_range('1/1/2000',
   periods=10), columns=list('ABCD'))

df.plot()


"""

If the index consists of dates, it calls gct().autofmt_xdate() to format the x-axis as shown in the above illustration.

We can plot one column versus another using the x and y keywords.

Plotting methods allow a handful of plot styles other than the default line plot. These methods can be provided as the kind keyword argument to plot(). These include âˆ’

bar or barh for bar plots
hist for histogram
box for boxplot
'area' for area plots
'scatter' for scatter plots
