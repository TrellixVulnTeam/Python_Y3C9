Python Pandas - Basic Functionality

By now, we learnt about the three Pandas DataStructures and how to create them. We will majorly focus on the DataFrame objects because of its importance in the real time data processing and also discuss a few other DataStructures.

Series Basic Functionality
S.No.	Attribute or Method	Description
1	axes	Returns a list of the row axis labels.
2	dtype	Returns the dtype of the object.
3	empty	Returns True if series is empty.
4	ndim	Returns the number of dimensions of the underlying data, by definition 1.
5	size	Returns the number of elements in the underlying data.
6	values	Returns the Series as ndarray.
7	head()	Returns the first n rows.
8	tail()	Returns the last n rows.
Let us now create a Series and see all the above tabulated attributes operation.

Example

"""

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

#Create a series with 100 random numbers
s = pd.Series(np.random.randn(4))
print (s)


"""

Its output is as follows âˆ’

0   0.967853
1  -0.148368
2  -1.395906
3  -1.758394
dtype: float64
