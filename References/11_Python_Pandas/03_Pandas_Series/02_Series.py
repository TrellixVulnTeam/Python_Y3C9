Create a Series from ndarray
If data is an ndarray, then index passed must be of the same length. If no index is passed, then by default index will be range(n) where n is array length, i.e., [0,1,2,3â€¦. range(len(array))-1].

"""

We did not pass any index, so by default, it assigned the indexes ranging from 0 to len(data)-1, i.e., 0 to 3.
