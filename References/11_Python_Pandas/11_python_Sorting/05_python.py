By Value
Like index sorting, sort_values() is the method for sorting by values. It accepts a 'by' argument which will use the column name of the DataFrame with which the values are to be sorted.


"""


import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

unsorted_df = pd.DataFrame({'col1':[2,1,1,1],'col2':[1,3,2,4]})
   sorted_df = unsorted_df.sort_values(by='col1')

print (sorted_df)



"""

Its output is as follows âˆ’

   col1  col2
1    1    3
2    1    2
3    1    4
0    2    1

Observe, col1 values are sorted and the respective col2 value and row index will alter along with col1. Thus, they look unsorted.

'by' argument takes a list of column values.
