Create a TimeStamp
Time-stamped data is the most basic type of timeseries data that associates values with points in time. For pandas objects, it means using the points in time. Let’s take an example −


"""


import pandas as pd
print (pd.Timestamp('2017-03-01'))

"""

Its output is as follows −

2017-03-01 00:00:00
