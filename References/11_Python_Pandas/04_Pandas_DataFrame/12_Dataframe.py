Column Addition
We will understand this by adding a new column to an existing data frame.

Example



"""

import pandas as pd

d = {'one' : pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index=['a', 'b', 'c']),
      'two' : pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])}

df = pd.DataFrame(d)

# Adding a new column to an existing DataFrame object with column label by passing new series

print ("Adding a new column by passing as Series:")
df['three']=pd.Series([10,20,30],index=['a','b','c'])
print (df)

print ("Adding a new column using the existing columns in DataFrame:")
df['four']=df['one']+df['three']

print (df)


"""

Its output is as follows âˆ’

Adding a new column by passing as Series:
     one   two   three
a    1.0    1    10.0
b    2.0    2    20.0
c    3.0    3    30.0
d    NaN    4    NaN

Adding a new column using the existing columns in DataFrame:
      one   two   three    four
a     1.0    1    10.0     11.0
b     2.0    2    20.0     22.0
c     3.0    3    30.0     33.0
d     NaN    4     NaN     NaN
