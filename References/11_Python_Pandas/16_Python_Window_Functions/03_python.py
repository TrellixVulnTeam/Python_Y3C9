Window functions are majorly used in finding the trends within the data graphically by smoothing the curve. If there is lot of variation in the everyday data and a lot of data points are available, then taking the samples and plotting is one method and applying the window computations and plotting the graph on the results is another method. By these methods, we can smooth the curve or the trend.
