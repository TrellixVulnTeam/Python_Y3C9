An alternative way of iterating through each item is by index offset into the sequence itself. Following is a simple example âˆ’"""

"""
Here, we took the assistance of the len() built-in function, which provides the total number of elements in the tuple as well as the range() built-in function to give us the actual sequence to iterate over."""
