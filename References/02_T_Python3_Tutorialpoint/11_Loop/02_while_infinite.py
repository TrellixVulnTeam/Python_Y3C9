The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes infinite loop if a condition never becomes FALSE. You must be cautious when using while loops because of the possibility that this condition never resolves to a FALSE value. This results in a loop that never ends. Such a loop is called an infinite loop.

An infinite loop might be useful in client/server programming where the server needs to run continuously so that client programs can communicate with it as and when required."""

var = 1
while var == 1 :  # This constructs an infinite loop
   num = int(input("Enter a number  :"))
   print ("You entered: ", num)

print ("Good bye!")

"""
The above example goes in an infinite loop and you need to use CTRL+C to exit the program."""
