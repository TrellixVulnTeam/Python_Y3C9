Python 3 - for Loop Statements
The for statement in Python has the ability to iterate over the items of any sequence, such as a list or a string.

Syntax
for iterating_var in sequence:
   statements(s)
If a sequence contains an expression list, it is evaluated first. Then, the first item in the sequence is assigned to the iterating variable iterating_var. Next, the statements block is executed. Each item in the list is assigned to iterating_var, and the statement(s) block is executed until the entire sequence is exhausted."""
