Class Inheritance
Instead of starting from a scratch, you can create a class by deriving it from a pre-existing class by listing the parent class in parentheses after the new class name.

The child class inherits the attributes of its parent class, and you can use those attributes as if they were defined in the child class. A child class can also override data members and methods from the parent.

Syntax
Derived classes are declared much like their parent class; however, a list of base classes to inherit from is given after the class name âˆ’

class SubClassName (ParentClass1[, ParentClass2, ...]):
   'Optional class documentation string'
   class_suite
