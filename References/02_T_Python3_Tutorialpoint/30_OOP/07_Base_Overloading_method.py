Base Overloading Methods
The following table lists some generic functionality that you can override in your own classes −

S.No.	Method, Description & Sample Call
1	
__init__ ( self [,args...] )

Constructor (with any optional arguments)

Sample Call : obj = className(args)

2	
__del__( self )

Destructor, deletes an object

Sample Call : del obj

3	
__repr__( self )

Evaluatable string representation

Sample Call : repr(obj)

4	
__str__( self )

Printable string representation

Sample Call : str(obj)

5	
__cmp__ ( self, x )

Object comparison

Sample Call : cmp(obj, x)

Overloading Operators
Suppose you have created a Vector class to represent two-dimensional vectors. What happens when you use the plus operator to add them? Most likely Python will yell at you.

You could, however, define the __add__ method in your class to perform vector addition and then the plus operator would behave as per expectation −

class Vector:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
      self.a = a
      self.b = b

    def __str__(self):
      return 'Vector (%d, %d)' % (self.a, self.b)
   
    def __add__(self,other):
      return Vector(self.a + other.a, self.b + other.b)

v1 = Vector(2,10)
v2 = Vector(5,-2)
print (v1 + v2)
