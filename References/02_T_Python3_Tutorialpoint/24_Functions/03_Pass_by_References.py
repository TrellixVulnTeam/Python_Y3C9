"""

There is one more example where argument is being passed by reference and the reference is being overwritten inside the called function.

"""


# Function definition is here
def changeme( mylist ):
   "This changes a passed list into this function"
   mylist = [1,2,3,4] # This would assi new reference in mylist
   print ("Values inside the function: ", mylist)
   return

# Now you can call changeme function
mylist = [10,20,30]
changeme( mylist )
print ("Values outside the function: ", mylist)


"""

The parameter mylist is local to the function changeme. Changing mylist within the function does not affect mylist. The function accomplishes nothing and finally this would produce the following result âˆ’

Values inside the function:  [1, 2, 3, 4]
Values outside the function:  [10, 20, 30]
