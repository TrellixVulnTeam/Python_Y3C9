Python 3 - break statement
The break statement is used for premature termination of the current loop. After abandoning the loop, execution at the next statement is resumed, just like the traditional break statement in C.

The most common use of break is when some external condition is triggered requiring a hasty exit from a loop. The break statement can be used in both while and for loops.

If you are using nested loops, the break statement stops the execution of the innermost loop and starts executing the next line of the code after the block.

Syntax
The syntax for a break statement in Python is as follows âˆ’
break"""

for letter in 'Python':     # First Example
   if letter == 'h':
      break
   print ('Current Letter :', letter)
  
var = 10                    # Second Example
while var > 0:              
   print ('Current variable value :', var)
   var = var -1
   if var == 5:
      break

print ("Good bye!")

The following program demonstrates use of the break in a for loop iterating over a list. User inputs a number, which is searched in the list. If it is found, then the loop terminates with the 'found' message."""

no = int(input('any number: '))
numbers = [11,33,55,39,55,75,37,21,23,41,13]

for num in numbers:
   if num == no:
      print ('number found in list')
      break
else:
   print ('number not found in list')
