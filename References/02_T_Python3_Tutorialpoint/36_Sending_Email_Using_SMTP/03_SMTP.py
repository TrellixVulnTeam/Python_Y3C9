Sending Attachments as an E-mail
To send an e-mail with mixed content requires setting the Content-type header to multipart/mixed. Then, the text and the attachment sections can be specified within boundaries.

A boundary is started with two hyphens followed by a unique number, which cannot appear in the message part of the e-mail. A final boundary denoting the e-mail's final section must also end with two hyphens.

The attached files should be encoded with the pack("m") function to have base 64 encoding before transmission.

Example
Following is an example, which sends a file /tmp/test.txt as an attachment. Try it once âˆ’
