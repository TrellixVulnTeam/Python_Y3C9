Python 3 - Identity Operators Example
Python built-in function id() returns a unique integer as identity of object. Identity operators compare the memory locations of two objects. There are two Identity operators as explained below âˆ’

Operator	Description	Example
is	Evaluates to true if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same object and false otherwise.	x is y, here is results in 1 if id(x) equals id(y).
is not	Evaluates to false if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same object and true otherwise.	x is not y, here is not results in 1 if id(x) is not equal to id(y).
Example"""

a = 20
b = 20
print ('Line 1','a=',a,':',id(a), 'b=',b,':',id(b))

if ( a is b ):
   print ("Line 2 - a and b have same identity")
else:
   print ("Line 2 - a and b do not have same identity")

if ( id(a) == id(b) ):
   print ("Line 3 - a and b have same identity")
else:
   print ("Line 3 - a and b do not have same identity")

b = 30
print ('Line 4','a=',a,':',id(a), 'b=',b,':',id(b))

if ( a is not b ):
   print ("Line 5 - a and b do not have same identity")
else:
   print ("Line 5 - a and b have same identity")
