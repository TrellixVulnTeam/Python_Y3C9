Intrinsic NumPy Array Creation
NumPy has built-in functions for creating arrays from scratch. Some of these functions are explained below.

Using zeros()
The zeros(shape) function will create an array filled with 0 values with the specified shape. The default dtype is float64. Let us consider the following example.



"""


import numpy as np
print (np.zeros((2, 3)))


"""

The output of the above program will be as follows.

array([[ 0., 0., 0.],
[ 0., 0., 0.]])
