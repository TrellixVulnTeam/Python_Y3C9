SciPy - Constants

SciPy constants package provides a wide range of constants, which are used in the general scientific area.

SciPy Constants Package
The scipy.constants package provides various constants. We have to import the required constant and use them as per the requirement. Let us see how these constant variables are imported and used.

To start with, let us compare the ‘pi’ value by considering the following example.

"""

#Import pi constant from both the packages
from scipy.constants import pi
from math import pi

print("sciPy - pi = %.16f"%scipy.constants.pi)
print("math - pi = %.16f"%math.pi)


"""

The above program will generate the following output.

sciPy - pi = 3.1415926535897931
math - pi = 3.1415926535897931
