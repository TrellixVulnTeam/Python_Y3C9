Remembering all of these are a bit tough. The easy way to get which key is for which function is with the scipy.constants.find() method. Let us consider the following example.



"""



import scipy.constants
res = scipy.constants.physical_constants["alpha particle mass"]
print (res)



"""
[
   'alpha particle mass',
   'alpha particle mass energy equivalent',
   'alpha particle mass energy equivalent in MeV',
   'alpha particle mass in u',
   'electron to alpha particle mass ratio'
   This method returns the list of keys, else nothing if the keyword does not match.
