    Python Strings
String Literals
String literals in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

'hello' is the same as "hello".

Strings can be output to screen using the print function. For example: print("hello").

Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.


Example
Get the character at position 1:"""

a = "hello"
print(a[1])
